 A musical track can be defined as a time-constrained sequence of notes.  
 The **time** is defined by a, possibly infinite, sequence of bars.  
 A bar isdivided by a sequence of n beats. In turn, each beat is sub-divided in a number ofticks. 
 This number ofticks per beat defines theresolutionof a track. 
 Common values for the resolution are one quarter or onethird of a beat. 
 A position in time is hence defined by a (bar,beat,tick) tuple. Notes have a position intime, 
 a value and a duration.  Possible values for a note are known in Latin countries asdo, 
 do#, re, re#mi, fa, fa#, sol, sol#, la, la# si
